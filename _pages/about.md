Hello and welcome
======
Hello! I'm a doctoral candidate at the University of New Mexico under the supervision of Benjamin Clark. Aside from my fondness of attractor dynamics, electrophysiology, and detailed behavioral analyses, I'm all about local coffee roasters, vivid hair colors, and growing my own food. More recently I've become fascinated by the role inhibitory interneurons play in supporting spatial navigation. My dissertation work aims to understand if postsubicular interneurons and spatially modulated cell types are dysfunctional in a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease.   

I am currently looking for a postdoctoral position that will start in 2021.

Research Interests
------

I study the neural circuity that is thought to support spatial navigation and spatial orientation. What fascinates me most about this topic is how internally generated senses, such as self-motion or head translation, interact with external sensory inputs, such as vision, to create stable representations of position within an environment. I use both detailed behavioral analysis and in-vivo electrophysiological techniques to answer questions relating to *1.) How animals interact with prominent environmental cues during spatial navigation or exploration* and *2.) How the firing dynamics of populations of neurons change as a function of the environment or across time.*
