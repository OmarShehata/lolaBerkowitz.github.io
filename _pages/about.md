Hello and welcome
======
Hello :) I'm a native Californian who's been living in the high desert of Albuquerque, New Mexico since 2015. You can call me Laura (she/her). Aside from my fondness of attractor dynamics, ephys, and detailed behavioral analyses, I'm all about local coffee roasters, vivid hair colors, and growing my own food. 

This website serves to summarize my work in translational neuroscience. Peruse the pages and click the links to papers/talks. Happy browsing.   

Research Interests
------

I study the neural circuity that is thought to support spatial navigation and spatial orientation. What fascinates me most about this topic is how internally generated senses, such as self-motion or head translation, interact with external sensory inputs, such as vision, to create stable representations of position within an environment. I use both detailed behavioral analysis and in-vivo electrophysiological techniques to answer questions relating to *1.) How animals interact with prominant environemntal cues during spatial navigation or exploration* and *2.) How the firing dynamics of populations of neurons change as a function of environment.* Additionally, I am also investigating how altered functioning of these neural systems may result in spatial disorientation, specifically related to Alzheimer’s disease. My disseration work aims to describe the functional consequences of Alzheimer’s disease pathology on the attractor dynamics in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer’s disease.
